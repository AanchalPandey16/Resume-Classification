# Resume-Classification
Resume classifier using NLP and TF-IDF to predict job roles from PDF/DOCX or pasted text. I tested Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, and Random Forest, then chose Multinomial Naive Bayes for quick, accurate results. It has a user interface that displays the extracted text, the top role, and confidence scores.
